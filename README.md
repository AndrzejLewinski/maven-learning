# Java Learning Project

This repository is a personal educational project designed to document my learning process in Java. It includes a variety of programming exercises, challenges, and terminal-based animations developed during different stages of my journey.

Many parts of this project — especially the animations — were created with the assistance of ChatGPT. I used ChatGPT to generate ideas, write code, and resolve technical issues. In several cases, I modified and customized the generated code to better align with my personal learning goals.

## Project Structure

The `java-learning` folder contains:

- A range of Java coding exercises, from beginner to intermediate level.
- Terminal-based animations created using symbols, text effects, and emoji.
- Code written independently or with guidance from ChatGPT.

---

## Animations

All animations in this project were created with the help of ChatGPT. I relied on ChatGPT to explore animation techniques in the Java console, develop ideas, and write base implementations. I then adjusted the code where needed for better control or learning.

### Included Animations:

- **Extreme Minimalistic Animation** – a simple progress bar using plant symbols.
- **Green Rain Animation** – an animation simulating a "green rain" effect with plant emojis.
- **Gradient Progress Bar** – a visually styled progress bar simulating a color gradient.
- **`myAnimation()`** – a basic dot-based loading animation .

> **Note**: All animations in this project were created with the assistance of ChatGPT, except for `myAnimation()`, which was written independently.

## Location of Animation Code

All animation-related Java source files are located in:

```
maven-learning/src/main/java/org/example/animations/
```

Each animation is implemented as a separate method in the `Animations.java` class. You can execute them individually or preview all available animations using the `previewAnimations()` method.

## Learning Objectives

The main learning goals of this project include:

- Understanding and applying control structures (loops, conditionals).
- Practicing string manipulation and console formatting.
- Writing modular code using methods and classes.
- Creating simple terminal-based visual effects.
- Developing debugging and problem-solving skills.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrzejLewinski/java-learning.git
   cd java-learning
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

3. Navigate to the appropriate class (e.g., `Animations.java`) and run the method you want to test.
