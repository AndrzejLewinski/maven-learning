# IntroductionToJava - ComparisonOperators

This project is part of an introductory Java learning module. It demonstrates key programming concepts using small, interactive console-based exercises. These include a multiplication table, a number-guessing game ("Hot and Cold"), and comparison-based logic.

## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Multiplication Table
- Displays a 10×10 multiplication table.
- Values equal to 0 are replaced with `__` for clarity.
- Properly spaced output for easy reading.

### ❄🔥 Getting Warmer, Getting Colder Game
- The program randomly picks a number from 1 to 100.
- The user guesses the number, receiving visual feedback:
    - 🧊 (ice cubes) for "cold" guesses.
    - 🔥 (flames) for "warm" guesses.
    - 🍀 (clover) when the correct number is guessed.
- Input is validated to ensure it's numeric and within the correct range.

### 🎯 Guess a Number (1–5)
- A simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 5.
- Continues looping until the correct number is guessed.

### 🔍 Number Comparison
- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Compares them and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second.
