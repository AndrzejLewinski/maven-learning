# 📘 IntroductionToJava - ComparisonOperators

This project is part of the *Introduction to Java* module and serves as a hands-on way to explore basic programming concepts using interactive, console-based applications. The exercises range from number guessing games to number manipulation and prime detection.

## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Multiplication Table
- Prints a **10×10 multiplication table**.
- Multiplications involving zero (`0`) are shown as `__` for clarity.
- Outputs are spaced for visual alignment.

### ❄🔥 Hot and Cold Number Game
- Randomly picks a number between **1 and 100**.
- User guesses and receives visual feedback based on the proximity:
    - `🧊` (ice cubes) for cold guesses.
    - `🔥` (flames) for warm guesses.
    - `🍀` (clover) for a correct guess.
- Input is validated for numeric correctness and range.

### 🎯 Guess a Number (1–5)
- Simple loop-based guessing game.
- User must guess the number (between 1–5) until it's correct.

### 🔍 Number Comparison
- Prompts user to enter two integers.
- Compares and prints whether the first is:
    - Greater than,
    - Less than,
    - Or equal to the second.

### 🔁 Reverse Integer
- Demonstrates reversing the digits of an integer using both `StringBuilder` and manual array manipulation.
- Outputs the reversed value step-by-step.

### 🔢 Prime Number Finder
- Iterates from 0 to 99.
- Identifies and displays all prime numbers in that range.
- Uses a basic prime-checking algorithm with animated feedback.
